			<h2>Game Developers Conferece (GDC) Narrative Review Competition (2015)</h2>
			<p>GDC is the largest Game industry conference and as a student I had the opportunity to submit a narrative review of a game. I was accepted and got the chance to present my review and poster in a wing of the conference and receive a student pass.</p>
			<p>I chose Spec Ops: The Line (Yager Development), released in 2012 it's very much a product of the time. A modern military shooter that could be mistaken for so many others of the generation. The game leans into all the tropes and problems of the time to make a story that implicates the player and developer in the violence on screen.</p>

			<h2>The Internet is an In-joke</h2>
			<p>My senior thesis from undergrad looked at the online activism of Anonymous, particularly during the Arab Spring. There's a seed of our current online woes in this study but I can't claim any foresight into the current digital landscape. I never thought studying memes would remain so relevant to politics. Re-reading this my only take away is they did it for the lulz.</p>
