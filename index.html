								<p>I was approached at a fundraiser for TAG and met Russell, he makes music and has a love for the old 8-bit era of games. He offered a few tracks to inspire some mini-games based on the track. I think it's curious we don't have music games in the style of music videos, this is the first game made in this series.</p>

								<p>A tech demo for teaching a Unity 3D workshop for <a href="http://taglabs.org/" target="_blank">TAG Labs</a> (I do a lot of work with them) and <a href="http://wearecolorcoded.us/" target="_blank">Color Coded DC</a>. I made in editor tools for Unity with the goal that people not familiar with scripting or Unity 3D could work on building a game and get a skin deep dive into game design. Ultimately I don't think I made a great tool for it but learned a great deal about customizing the Unity editor for projects.</p>

								<p>This was a general purpose exclamation in my household. I thought it was more common but friends have informed me it's the first they've heard. *Shrug* Blatant rip-off of <a href="http://www.adultswim.com/games/web/robot-unicorn-attack">Robot Unicorn Attack on Adult Swim</a>. It's a joke game friends, we have fun here.</p>

								<p>A game made in collaboration with <a href="#">Spark Media</a>, the game is inspired by the historic abolition of the Costa Rican Armed Forces and the iconic image forever attached to the event: Costa Rica’s visionary leader and President, Don Pepe, using a sledge hammer to knock down the walls of the country’s military headquarters, the Cuartel Bellavista on December 1st, 1948.  First contract game made.</p>
