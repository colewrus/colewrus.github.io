			<h2>Game Developers Conferece (GDC) Narrative Review Competition (2015)</h2>
			<p>GDC is the largest Game industriy conference and as a student I had the opportunity to submit a narrative review of a game. I was accepted and got the chance to present my review and poster in a wing of the conference and receive a student pass.</p>
			<p>I chose Spec Ops: The Line (Yager Development), released in 2012 it's very much a product of the time. A modern military shooter that could be mistaken for so many other Call of Duty copies of the generation. The game leans into all the tropes and problems of the time to make a story that implicates the player and developer in the violence on screen.</p>
